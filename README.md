# AI Chat Full-Stack App

## Project Overview
This project is a full-stack AI chat application built with React, Remix, TypeScript, and Node.js. It allows users to interact with an LLM (OpenAI) and stores all conversations in a PostgreSQL database for future retrieval and analysis.

## Architecture & Approach
- **Frontend:** Built with React and Remix, styled with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern UI. The chat interface supports prompt input, displays AI responses, and shows conversation history.
- **Backend:** Node.js API routes handle prompt submission, call the OpenAI API, validate input, and process errors. All exchanges are saved to PostgreSQL using Prisma ORM.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL is used for persistent storage of all user queries and AI responses, with a unique GUID per user/browser for privacy.
- **Testing:** Unit and integration tests are written using Vitest and Testing Library to ensure reliability.
- **Deployment:** The app is deployed on Vercel, with environment variables securely managed for production.

## Assumptions & Notes
- Each user/browser is assigned a unique GUID to keep chat histories private.
- The app is designed for scalability and can be extended with authentication or additional features as needed.
- Error handling is implemented for both API and database operations.

## Future Improvements
- Add authentication for user accounts and private chat history.
- Implement rate limiting and monitoring for production.
- Expand test coverage and add E2E tests.

## Acknowledgements
Significant portions of the development process, including architecture decisions, debugging, and code implementation, were completed with the help of the Cursor AI coding assistant.

For development, see the original Remix and Tailwind docs for more details on running and styling the app.

# Welcome to Remix!

- ðŸ“– [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Development

Run the dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever css framework you prefer. See the [Vite docs on css](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) for more information.
